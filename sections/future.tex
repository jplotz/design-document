The WADT project is the team's opportunity to support cybersecurity education and make the greatest of all makeable things, a useful tool. We want to see the project revolutionize the workflow of our target market and make jumping into a lab as quick and easy as one-click shipping.

Tedium is the worst thing that smart people can be subjected to, and WADT gets rid of some of it for students and the instructor. We hope that by making it easier to get started, students can retain their motivation for the problems they're really after.

We also hope that in creating a free and open-source tool, our same users will become our contributors as they envision new changes to WADT that we couldn't have imagined ourselves. We have strived to create a maintainable codebase with low technical debt, so that future Senior Design groups or users may pick up our project again. Ideally, others may use what they have learned to make something neat, as we are doing.

And rounding up our hopes for WADT, the most important vision has come from our project sponsor. We know that he will put our MVP in the hands of real users and appreciate the objective which he has given to the group. We have built up a great deal of confidence in our sponsor as a long-term project owner who can carry the project forward to future teams of developers, or develop it further into a more available webapp that can serve more users.
