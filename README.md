"This is a group deliverable.  The entire document should be in either omniscient voice or we/us/our voice, not I/me/my voice."

We aim to implement most-recently-used sorting for the container catalog :grin: :grin: :grin:


# Table of contents
This is automatically generated with the `\tableofcontents` line.
If you add a section without numbers, see [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Table_of_contents) for how to include it
in the table of contents.

# Including source code
[minted](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Code_Highlighting_with_minted)

if needed, we can change the default settings.

An example:
```latex
\begin{minted}{python}
def sum(x, y):
    return x + y
\end{minted}
```

"Don't include source code without a good reason--and there's no good reason to include more than small chunks."
